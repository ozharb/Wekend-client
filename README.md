# WEkend
A social app for posting casual weekend events and activities for your friends to see.

This repo is the front-end client, built in React.  You can see the app live at [tps://wekend-client-ozharb.vercel.app/days/]

The app is meant for mobile use, but scales for desktop viewing.

To check out the app, I suggest you create a dummy account so you can see the onboarding experience.  But if you just want to view what the program looks like, you can use the demo account.
